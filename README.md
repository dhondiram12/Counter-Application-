# Counter-Application-
counter Application using ReactJS 
simple counter application using React JS, Vite, State Variables, CSS, and JSX.


ðŸ‘‰ I learned how to use state variables and hooks in React for managing dynamic data. I added two key functionalities:

âž• Add â€“ to increment the counter.
ðŸ”„Reset â€“ to reset the counter to 0.

This was a fun project that helped me understand the power of React's state management and how to create interactive applications with Vite for fast development!
